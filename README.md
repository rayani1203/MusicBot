# MusicBot

This is an interactive discord bot, programmed using discord.py. It responds to a variety of commands that allow it to join and leave voice channels, respond to users in text channels, as well as play, pause, stop, and queue selected songs to be played in voice channels. Music is played using the youtube.dl library which allows the bot to download a specified song and then play it, although memory is actively managed by deleting any files no longer in use.
